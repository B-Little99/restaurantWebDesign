# Overview

This was a simple project to test my skills at designing a simple and elegant layout for a restaurant website, which is the main home page.

It consists of a navigation bar, a moving carousel, opening times, about us and a map included on the page. I had never used iFrames before, but they are relatively easy to grasp and just needed some embedding from Google maps and minor style tweaks.
